To use this template, run:

```quarto use template NIEHS/dtt-revealjs-template```

Alternatively, you can add the format (without the template) into an existing project or directory:

```quarto add NIEHS/dtt-revealjs-template```

However, take note that you will then need to manually modify your presentation to include the metadata that is contained in the template document.
